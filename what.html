                  <ul>
                  <li>COVID-19 spreads easily from person to person, mainly by the following routes:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet).</li>
                  <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks.
                  <ul>
                  <li>Respiratory droplets cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited on mucous membranes, such as those that line the inside of the nose and mouth.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>People who are infected but do not have symptoms can also spread the virus to others.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Less common ways COVID-19 can spread</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Under certain circumstances (for example, when people are in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation), COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by airborne tramission</li>
                  <li>COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces.</li>

     <div class="spacer">
        <h2 class="h3 mt-0 pt-0" style="padding-left: 50px;">Improve Your Diet</h2>
        <p>The food you eat plays a key aspect in determining your overall health and immunity. Eat low carb diets, as this will help control high blood sugar and pressure.  A low carb diet will help slow down diabetes and focus on a protein-rich diet to keep you in good shape. And regularly consume vegetables and fruits rich in Beta carotene, Ascorbic acid &amp; other essential vitamins. Certain foods like mushrooms, tomato, bell pepper and green vegetables like broccoli, spinach are also good options to build resilience in the body against infections.</p>
        <p>You can also eat supplements rich in omega 3 &amp; 6 fatty acids for your daily dose, if stepping out to buy groceries is not an option during social distancing. Some natural immunity supplements include ginger, gooseberries (amla) and turmeric. Some of these superfoods are common ingredients in Indian dishes and snacks. There are several herbs that help in boosting immunity like garlic, Basel leaves and Black cumin. Certain seeds and nuts like sunflower seeds, Flax seed, pumpkin seeds and melon seeds are excellent sources of protein and vitamin E.</p>
        <div class="spacer">
        <h2 class="h3 mt-0 pt-0" style="padding-left: 50px;"><strong>Don’t Compromise on Sleep</strong></h2>
        p>Good snooze time for 7-8 hours is the best way to help your body build immunity; lesser sleep will leave you tired and impair your brain activity. The lack of sleep will prevent the body from resting and this will impair other bodily functions that will have a direct impact on your immunity. Lack of sleep adversely affects the action of the flu vaccine.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2 class="h3 mt-0 pt-0" style="padding-left: 50px;">Stay Hydrated</h2>
        <p>Drink up to 8-10 glasses of water every day, to stay hydrated. Hydration will help flush out the toxins from the body and lower the chances of flu. Other alternatives include juices made of citrus fruits and coconut water, to beat the heat.</p>
        <div class="spacer">
       
        <h2 class="h3 mt-0 pt-0" style="padding-left: 50px;"> Practice meditation and Don’t Skip on Exercise</h2>
        <p>A good diet should be followed by an exercise routine. Remember to exercise regularly; even light exercise will go a long way in releasing the toxins from your body. It is recommended to exercise for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on your stamina. If you have not started exercising yet, then it is a good time to start. There are several Youtube channels and apps to help you exercise at home. Regular exercise improves metabolism, which has a direct correlation with body immunity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Too much stress releases the hormone known as cortisol, which impairs your response to immediate surroundings and makes your body susceptible to infections; you are left feeling constantly anxious. The best way to relieve stress is through meditation, it is a tried and tested activity to calm the nerves. If you need help meditating, then there are several channels on youtube that have instructional resources to help you meditate.</li>
            </ul>
        <div class="spacer">

            <h2 class="h3 mt-0 pt-0" style="padding-left: 50px;">Destress Yourself</h2>
            <p>These are testing times, and a prolonged period of staying indoors has its implications on your mental wellbeing. The growing anxiety around the pandemic is another concern that is affecting millions across the globe. While the uncertainty might be overwhelming, there are  few steps we can follow regularly to help relieve our stress, stress is known to have an adverse effect on immunity.</p>
